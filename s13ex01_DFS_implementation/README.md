## DFS implementation

Implement depth-first search in an undirected graph without using recursion and
second version using it. Compare both approaches.

### Algorithm/Solution

Implement it in CppLibraries repo as a training. There is already a lot of
description in book from the course Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne shared by
MALLA REDDY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING (I hope it's legal...)
https://mrce.in/ebooks/Algorithms%204th%20Ed.pdf in Chapter 4.

It will be good to implement it using proposed `Graph` class what can be used
for all operations on graphs!

Once implemented source code and/or link will be given.

### Complexity
