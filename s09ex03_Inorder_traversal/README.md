## Inorder traversal

Design an algorithm to perform an inorder traversal of a binary search tree
using only a constant amount of extra space.

Hint: you may modify the BST during the traversal provided you restore it upon
completion.

### Algorithm

That will be some kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal variation but it 
needs to be rechecked.
