 * Problem: Egg Drop
 * 
 * Description:
 * Given an n-story building and plenty of eggs, find the floor T where eggs start 
 * breaking when dropped. An egg breaks if dropped from floor T or higher, and 
 * survives drops from floors below T.
 * 
 * Implementations:
 * 
 * Version 0:
 * - Constraints: 1 egg, ≤T tosses
 * - Approach: Linear search from bottom up
 * - Time Complexity: O(T) where T is the breaking point floor
 * - Space Complexity: O(1)
 * - Strategy: Check each floor sequentially until egg breaks
 * 
 * Version 1:
 * - Constraints: ~1lg n eggs and ~1lg n tosses
 * - Approach: k-way partitioning where k ≈ n/lg n
 * - Time Complexity: O(lg n)
 * - Space Complexity: O(1)
 * - Strategy: Divide building into segments of size n/lg n, find correct segment,
 *   then binary search within that segment
 * 
 * Version 2:
 * - Constraints: ~lg T eggs and ~2lg T tosses
 * - Approach: Exponential search followed by binary search
 * - Time Complexity: O(lg T) for exponential search + O(lg T) for binary search
 * - Space Complexity: O(1)
 * - Strategy: First find upper bound using powers of 2, then binary search in range
 * 
 * Version 3:
 * - Constraints: 2 eggs and ~2√n tosses
 * - Approach: Jump search followed by linear search
 * - Time Complexity: O(√n) for first egg + O(√n) for second egg = O(2√n)
 * - Space Complexity: O(1)
 * - Strategy: Use first egg to jump √n floors at a time, use second egg for
 *   linear search in the identified range
 * 
 * Note: All versions maintain optimal complexity within their given constraints
 * of eggs and tosses allowed.
